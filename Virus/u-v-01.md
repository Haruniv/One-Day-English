### Virus

A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms. The study of viruses is called vir-ology, which is a part of microbiology. Viruses consist of genetic materials surrounded by a protective coat of protein, so they are more difficult to kill than bac-teria. In the case of a minor ailment induced by a viral infection, the optimal strategy is to allow the malady to progress naturally. Is is crucial to recognize the antibiotics, designed to combat bacterial infections, lack efficacy against viral entities. Antibiotics do not kill viruses and the use of them just leads to antibiotic resistance.
