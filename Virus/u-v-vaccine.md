## Vaccine

A vaccine is a preparation that is used to stimulate the body's immune response against diseases. The safety and efficacy of vaccines have undergone extensive scrutiny and validation.
Typically, a vaccine comprises an agent that resembles a pathogenic microorganism and is derived from attenuated or inactivated forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins.
This agent serves to elicit a response from the body's immune system, facilitating its recognition, destruction, and the development of immunological memory to guard against the perceived threat.
Vaccionation is considered as the most effective means of preventing infectious diseases.
